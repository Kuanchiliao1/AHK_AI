This script is designed to interact with the OpenAI API and generate various types of text based on user input. The user can highlight a section of text and then enter a command to generate different types of output.

## Features
- The script checks for the existence of an API key file (API_Key.ini) and prompts the user to enter their key if it does not exist.
- The script allows the user to enter a command to generate different types of text output, such as fill in the blank statements, key points, terminology, summaries, and explanations.
- The script uses the clipboard to get the text that the user has highlighted.
- The script posts a request to the OpenAI API with the user's input and command, and returns the generated text.

## How to use
1. Press the F12 button to activate the script.
2. Highlight the text you want to generate output for.
3. Enter a command to specify the type of output you want. The following commands are available:
   - `c` or `cloze`: generates fill in the blank statements
   - `k` or `key points`: extracts key points in bullet format
   - `kt` or `tk`: extracts key points and defines any terminology an average reader might struggle with
   - `t` or `terminology`: defines any terminology an average reader might struggle with
   - `s` or `summary`: summarizes the text
   - `t` or `thought`: generates thought-provoking points and questions
   - `x` or `explain`: explains the text in simple terms
   - Leave the command field blank to only use the highlighted text as a prompt
4. The script will post a request to the OpenAI API and return the generated text output.

## Note
- The script does not currently have any validations in place for the API key, so if the key needs to be changed, it must be manually edited in the API_Key.ini file.
- The script uses the WinHttpRequest library to make the API request.
- The script is currently set to use the "text-davinci-003" model, and has a maximum token limit of 1000.
- The script uses the `temperature` parameter to control the randomness of the generated output. The current setting is 1234.

## Additional Information
This script was written in AutoHotkey and is designed to be used on Windows. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the OpenAI API, which provides a machine learning platform for generating human-like text. The script is designed to make it easy for users to interact with the API and generate different types of text output.
